Today you continue building Blog Post API.

Backend needs to grant data persistance via MongoDB

Your backend should now save authors/users in their own collection, therefore you should link blogposts to their corresponding author and you should have CRUD for authors/users.

Complete past homework :)

Extras

üëç Likes system

Likes should be an array of user ids that is attached on the blogpost schema.

Whenever you click on the like button add the id of the user to that array.

Therefore you know if someone liked or not by checking if it is in the array!

You can check length of array to get total claps , its simple!
